# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Christopher Nwokwule

I'm a passionate web developer with a love for creating engaging and interactive web experiences. My journey in development has been an exciting adventureâ€”one that's grown to include not just web technologies but also Python and Machine Learning.

## ðŸ”­ What I Do

I specialize in building modern, responsive web applications using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**. From crafting beautiful front-end interfaces to developing robust back-end systems, I enjoy every part of the development process.

In addition to full-stack development, I also work with **Python** for scripting, automation, data analysis, and building machine learning models.

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & Python

I have hands-on experience in:
- **Python programming** for data-driven tasks and backend logic
- **Machine Learning** using libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`
- Building and evaluating predictive models for classification, regression, and clustering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization
- Working with Jupyter notebooks and real-world datasets

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

I'm always learning and expanding my skillset. Right now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into:
- Advanced **React** and **Next.js**
- **TypeScript** and scalable architecture
- **Deep Learning** with TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Model deployment and MLOps tools

## ðŸ‘¯ Let's Collaborate

I'm open to collaborating on both web development and machine learning projects. If you have an idea or need a developer to bring your project to lifeâ€”letâ€™s connect and build something awesome together!
